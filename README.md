Ultra light single-file JavaScript "framework" for quickly structuring loose and baggy spaghetti code. 

This is an experiment in evolving a JS framework as minimally as possible, starting from zero, entirely driven by need, as such need arises in the gradual modernization of a mudball of older JavaScript code. Nothing is added until it solves a specific problem in the cleanup of the old code; nothing is added in advance merely because we know it to exist in other frameworks. Besides helping organize the legacy code, the fun goal is to see what shape of "framework" grows from these specific evolutionary constraints, and how it may or may not end up resembling the various well-known frameworks.
